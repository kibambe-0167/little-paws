# Problem
Task Overview:
Your task is to develop a sign-up and login screen using OTP for a mobile
application. The designs have been provided in Figma, and your task is to implement
them using React Native. The app should allow users to sign up and log in using their
phone numbers, and verify their identity through OTP. You will be given 32 hours to
implement the functionality.
Deliverables:
● A React Native project that implements the sign-up and login screens with
OTP verification.
● The project should be submitted as a GitHub repository with a detailed
README file that explains how to run the project, how to use the OTP
verification feature, and any other relevant details.
● A demo video or a set of screenshots showing the app in action.
Requirements:
1. The app should have two screens, one for sign up and one for login, with a
consistent design.
2. Users should be able to enter their phone numbers in the sign-up and login
screens.
3. Users should be able to receive OTPs via SMS.
4. Users should be able to enter the OTP they receive in the app to verify their
identity.
5. Users should be able to resend OTPs if they don't receive them or if they enter
the wrong number.
6. The app should handle errors and provide appropriate feedback to the user.
7. The app should be optimized for different screen sizes and orientations.
8. The app should be compatible with iOS and Android devices.
